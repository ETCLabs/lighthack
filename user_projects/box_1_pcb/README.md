# #lighthack PCB

This folder contins the required files and documents to create a "more compact" version of the #lighthack. <br />
Gerber files are provided in order for people to easily order the project from their prefered PCB manufacturer. I can highly recommend JLCPCB, as I have been getting my PCBs from them since 2015, and I haven't complained once about build quality / performance. 

The PCB is the exact same design as the "box-1" except that the Arduino is now embedded in the PCB. The PCB was designed in EasyEDA, but a schematic is provided in case you want to recreate in your prefered software. 

The PCB is fully compatible with consoles, and has been tested on an ETC Ion XP, ETC Gio@5 and ETC Ion XE.
